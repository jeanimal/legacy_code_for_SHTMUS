# legacy_code_for_SHTMUS
This C code and data files are from the late 1990's.  They were used to generate the results discussed in the book, Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart (SHTMUS).

As of 2016-12-07, I have not tried to compile anything.

* Pmmsource_new: Closest to the code used for the book.  My file system shows it was last touched in 2004.
* INFER_re: A partial rewrite to do more cool stuff that I can't remember.  My file system shows it was last touched in 2011.

Data sets with real values were binaritized externally.

UPDATE: An R version of equivalent code is available at:
* Github: https://github.com/jeanimal/heuristica
* CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heuristica/index.html
