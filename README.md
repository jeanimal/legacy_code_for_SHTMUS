# legacy_code_for_SHTMUS
This code from the late 1990's generated the data discussed in the book, Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart (SHTMUS).

As of 2016-12-07, I have not tried to compile anything.
Pmmsource_new: Closest to the code used for the book.  My file system shows it was last touched in 2004.
INFER_re: A partial rewrite to do more cool stuff that I can't remember.  My file system shows it was last touched in 2011.
Data sets with real values were binaritized externally.
