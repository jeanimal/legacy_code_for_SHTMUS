Results on my Macintosh for INFER simulations to compare algorithm performance.

Names of directories are in the format:
algorithm.datatype.simtype

algorithms are
ttb	take the best
ulinT	unit linear (not trimmed!!  I just forgot to lop off the T in getsiminfo.c)
reg	regression
rnd	minimalist (random cue order)

datatypes are
bin	binary cues
real	real-valued cues (in whatever their original form was)

simtype
CV	cross-validation (build model on one half, test on other half)
FV	fit-validation (build model on one half, test on that same data)
	straight fit (build model on all the data, test on all the data)



Inside each directory, you'll find the following:
Ave	directory of files with average score on each data set
CI	directory of files with all 10,000 scores on each data set
sumAve	file summarizing the average scores in directory Ave
sumCI	file with the confidence intervals based on the data in CI
Note: straight fit doesn't have CI and sumCI since there's only one fit per data set.

To generate these summary results, use the perl commands I have set up.


spitlast.pl dirName > outputFile to summarize the average scores. 
It "spits" out the "last" number of each file, preceded by the file name. e.g.
spitlast.pl Ave > sumAve

dirci.pl dirName > outputFile to calculate confidence intervals for 10,000 scores.  
This run overa  whole "dir"ectory's "CI"s takes several minutes as it involves calculations. e.g.
dirci.pl CI > sumCI

Do a cartwheel for me, since I'm stuck in front of this keyboard.
